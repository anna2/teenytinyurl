Teeny Tiny URL
=========

Teeny Tiny URL is a bitly clone that lets you shorten URLS.  Current features: create a shortened URL without logging in or log in to create shortened URLs and manage your previously shortened URLs. I built this to practice configuring a SQLite database, querying with Active Record and SQL, implementing a user authentication system from scratch, working with Sinatra, and using Bootstrap and CSS.

##How to use it

Clone the repository. From inside the root directory, run ```shotgun``` from the command line, and navigate to localhost:9393.

##To do

There are a few more features I would like to add:

1. Display to users how many times their shortened link has been followed.
2. Display click data graphically.
3. Add validations to ensure only valid URLS can be submitted for transformation.
4. Deploy.
