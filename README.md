Teeny Tiny URL
=========

Teeny Tiny URL is a bitly clone that lets you shorten URLS.  Current features: create a shortened URL without logging in or log in to create shortenend URLs and manage your previously shortened URLs. I built this to practice configuring a Sqlite database, querying with Active Record and SQL, implementing a user authetication system from scratch, and using Bootstrap and CSS.
