Teeny Tiny URL
=========

Teeny Tiny URL is a bitly clone that lets you shorten URLS.  Current features: create a shortened URL without logging in or log in to create shortenend URLs and manage your previously shortened URLs. I built this to practice configuring a Sqlite database, querying with Active Record and SQL, and implementing a user authetication system from scratch.

##How to use it

Download the whole shebang. From inside the tinyurl directory, run ```rackup``` from the command line and navigate to localhost:9292. Or, run ```shotgun``` from the command line, and navigate to localhost:9393.
